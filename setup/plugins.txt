# This file contains a list of plugins to install. To override, add entries in ~/.config/dotfiles/plugins.txt.
# This file will be ignored if that file exists. But the structure must be the same:
#
# intended_shell plugin_type plugin_name remote_uri file_to_source
#
# Currently only 'git' is supported as a value for plugin_type.
