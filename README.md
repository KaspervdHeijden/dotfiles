## Dotfiles

This repository allows for quickly setup the environment how I like it :)

### Installation

From the home directory, add the following line to the `.bashrc` file:
```sh
source <dotfiles-dir>/bashrc.sh;
```

And, if you use zsh, add the following to the `.zshrc` file:
```sh
source <dotfiles-dir>/zshrc.sh;
```
